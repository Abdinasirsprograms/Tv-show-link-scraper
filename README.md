### Python 3.7 required

> You can download python from the [startguide.html](https://github.com/Abdinasirsprograms/Tv-show-link-scraper/blob/master/startguide.html) included in the prject folder that has the direct links to download python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website. Alternatively, you can download the files yourself.

### Step #1
Once you've installed or if you already have python, please run the below command from the root directory.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Step #2
all the requirements should be installed. Once they're installed, run the below command

```scrapy crawl watchSpider```

### Step #3
Please be patient as the program is slow and does output multiple lines of the same information, this is my first program using scrapy :)
