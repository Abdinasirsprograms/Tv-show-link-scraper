### Python 3.7 required

> You can download python from the [startguide.html] included in the prject folder that has the direct links to download python from [python.org] website. Alternatively, you can download the files yourself.

Once you've installed or if you already have python, please run the below command from the root directory.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

all the requirements should be installed. Once they're installed, run the below command

```scrapy crawl watchSpider```

Please be patient as the program is slow and does output multiple lines of the same information, this is my first program using scrapy :)
